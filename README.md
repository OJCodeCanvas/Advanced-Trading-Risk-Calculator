An advanced simple calculator for forex traders 
Forex, Index, Stock, and Commodity Risk Calculator
Overview
The Forex, Index, Stock, and Commodity Risk Calculator is a web-based tool designed to help traders manage risk in Forex trading, index CFDs, stock CFDs, and commodities (e.g., Gold). It calculates the risk per trade, lot/contract/share sizes, profit potential, and the number of consecutive winning or losing trades needed to meet specific financial goals or blow an account. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, the calculator is lightweight, responsive, and easy to use.
Features

Instrument Support:
Forex/Commodities: Major pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, USD/JPY), cross-currency pairs (e.g., EUR/GBP), exotics (e.g., USD/HKD), and Gold (XAU/USD).
Indices: US30 (Dow Jones), S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, FTSE 100, DAX 40, and more.
Stocks: Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and other popular CFD stocks.


Calculations:
Stop Loss Amount: Monetary risk per trade based on account balance and drawdown percentage.
Lot/Contract/Shares: Position size for Forex (lots), indices (CFDs), or stocks (shares).
Profit Amount: Profit per trade based on a user-defined risk-reward ratio (default 1:2).
Pips/Points/Shares for Profit: Number of pips (Forex/Gold), points (indices), or shares (stocks) needed for profit.
Consecutive Losing Trades: Number of losing trades before reaching the maximum drawdown threshold.
Consecutive Winning Trades: Number of winning trades to reach a user-specified profit target.


Currency Support: Calculations in USD, EUR, or GBP, with fixed exchange rates for conversions.
Input Validation: Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., negative values, non-numeric entries).
Warnings: Alerts for high-risk drawdowns (>2%), extreme drawdown thresholds (>75%), or ambitious profit targets (>200%).
Responsive Design: Works on mobile and desktop devices using Tailwind CSS.

Installation

Download the HTML File:
Obtain the index.html file containing the calculator (available in the project repository or generated separately).


Run Locally:
Open index.html in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
No server is required, as the application uses a CDN for Tailwind CSS (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css) and runs client-side JavaScript.


Optional Deployment:
Host the index.html file on a static web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) for online access.
Ensure the Tailwind CSS CDN URL is accessible.
